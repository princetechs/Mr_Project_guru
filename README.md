## Introduction

This document outlines a set of best practices for software development. Following these practices can help improve the quality, efficiency, and success of your software projects.

## 1. Research

- Research about the problem and solution.
- Understand the problem and explore possible solutions.

## 2. Authentication

- Add authentication.
- Implement an authentication system.

## 3. Library Search/Extension

- Find any library available for this work or extend the library as per requirement.
- Look for existing libraries that could help with your project. If necessary, extend these libraries.

## 4. Type-Safe Code

- Maintain type-safe codes.
- Write your code in a way that prevents type errors.

## 5. Build & Test

- Run build in every work done.
- After every significant change, build your project and run all tests.

## 6. Version Control

- Push to git regularly.
- Regularly commit your changes and push them to a remote repository.

## 7. Code Obfuscation

- Obfuscate the code for security at the end.
- Before releasing your application, obfuscate your code to make it harder for others to reverse engineer your application.

## 8. Keep it Simple

- Avoid overcomplicating your code. Write code that is easy to read and understand.

## 9. Have a Backout Plan

- Be prepared to revert changes if something goes wrong.

## 10. Understand How to Estimate

- Have realistic goals about the time and resources required for your project.

## 11. Make it Rugged

- Your software should be robust and able to handle unexpected situations.

## 12. Commitment to Client Success

- Always prioritize the needs of your clients.

## 13. Encourage Innovation and Experimentation

- Don't be afraid to try new approaches and technologies.

## 14. Utilize Automation

- Automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency.

## 15. Collaborate and Pair Up Often

- Teamwork can lead to better ideas and solutions.

## 16. Adjust Best Practices as Teams Grow and Change

- Be flexible and willing to change your practices as necessary.

## 17. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

- Avoid writing code for future use cases that might never come.

Feel free to incorporate these best practices into your software development process, and adapt them as needed for your specific project and team.
